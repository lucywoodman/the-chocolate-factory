# UX

## Strategy

### The Problem

When researching the craft chocolate industry, I discovered that consumers are craving quality in their chocolate, but the production of fine flavour cacao may decrease in the coming years. This is due to cacao farmers not making much more of a profit on fine cacao to justify the extra hassle that the fine cacao crop requires.

### The Solution

Let's push the focus to the cacao farmers. These are the people that take care of the crop and allow the rest of the world to experience the joy and comfort of chocolate. They should be recognised and celebrated.

My re-imagined version of The Chocolate Factory will source fine cacao producers specifically, and invest in the business relationship to support them to not only keep going, but to thrive. We will share their faces and their stories, championing and celebrating the hard work that they do.

Through these relationships and with the support of the cacao producers, we can provide the best craft chocolate in the world and help to rebuild the fine cacao industry with an awesome website and social media marketing :fist:.

### Target Audience

Consumers that love and appreciate quality chocolate, where it comes from, the care that goes into making it and the health benefits it provides.

### Personas
Arthur and Marie, both 44, married, parents. Arthur is an old-fashioned romantic that likes to treat his wife with flowers and chocolates, and will make sure to find something that she's happy with. Marie is environmentally conscious and enjoys high-quality products. She works in Marketing and appreciates good branding too.

Nina, 26, single. Works remotely and travels the world - a "digital nomad". Loves getting lost in the cultures of different countries and is aware of difficulties that some communities have. She donates to charities often that help to boost economies in developing countries, helping entrepreneurs to start businesses for example. She always looks for companies with a similar mission to buy gifts for family and friends back home.
