# UX

## Strategy

### The Problem

When researching the craft chocolate industry, I discovered that consumers are craving quality in their chocolate, but the production of fine flavour cacao may decrease in the coming years. This is due to cacao farmers not making much more of a profit on fine cacao to justify the extra hassle that the fine cacao crop requires.

### The Solution

Let's push the focus to the cacao farmers. These are the people that take care of the crop and allow the rest of the world to experience the joy and comfort of chocolate. They should be recognised and celebrated.

My re-imagined version of The Chocolate Factory will source fine cacao producers specifically, and invest in the business relationship to support them to not only keep going, but to thrive. We will share their faces and their stories, championing and celebrating the hard work that they do.

Through these relationships and with the support of the cacao producers, we can provide the best craft chocolate in the world and help to rebuild the fine cacao industry with an awesome website and social media marketing :fist:.

### Target Audience

Consumers that love and appreciate quality chocolate, where it comes from, the care that goes into making it and the health benefits it provides.

### Personas
Arthur and Marie, both 44, married, parents. Arthur is an old-fashioned romantic that likes to treat his wife with flowers and chocolates, and will make sure to find something that she's happy with. Marie is environmentally conscious and enjoys high-quality products. She works in Marketing and appreciates good branding too.

Nina, 26, single. Works remotely and travels the world - a "digital nomad". Loves getting lost in the cultures of different countries and is aware of difficulties that some communities have. She donates to charities often that help to boost economies in developing countries, helping entrepreneurs to start businesses for example. She always looks for companies with a similar mission to buy gifts for family and friends back home.

## Scope

### User Expectations
1. As a user I expect the app to be responsive.
2. As a user I expect the app to be accessible.
3. As a user I expect my data to be secure.

### User Stories
4. As a consumer, I want to see an interesting homepage with information on the store and the type of products it sells.
5. As a consumer, I want to subscribe to a newsletter to receive updates about the store.
6. As a consumer that's already subscribed, I want to unsubscribe from the newsletter when I don't want to receive it anymore.
7. As a consumer, I want to register my profile so I can save my personal information for future shopping.
8. As a consumer, I want to view the list of products available so I can see what the store has to offer.
9. As a consumer, I want to see the products by category to narrow down my search.
10. As a consumer, I want to filter the products to narrow down my search.
11. As a consumer, I want to search products so I can find something specific.
12. As a consumer, I want to add products to my cart so I can save them for purchasing later.
13. As a consumer, I want to remove products from my cart if I change my mind.
14. As a consumer, I want to adjust the quantities of items in my card so I can buy more/less of the same item.
15. As a consumer, I want to a checkout process so I can review my cart and add my details to complete my purchase.
16. As a consumer, I want to provide my card details so I can pay for the products in my cart.
17. As a consumer, I want to have my payment processed so I can complete my order.
18. As a consumer with a profile, I want my details to be autofilled to make purchases quicker and easier.
19. As a consumer, I want to see feedback on my actions, such as order completion, to confirm what action I've taken.

### User (Owner) Stories
20. As the store owner, I want to add products to the store as our range evolves and we add variety.
21. As the store owner, I want to update products when prices change and ensure the description is up to date.
22. As the store owner, I want to delete products when they're no longer available.
23. As the store owner, I want to send newsletters to our mailing list to share store news and updates.

I ranked the user stories by order of importance and how feasible/viable they are to complete. This let me chart the resulting numbers (see priority chart below) to help work out whether or not to include the features in the project given the constraints.

The priorities are "critical", "need", "nice to have", "want". I made sure to get all of the "critical" and "needed" features into the first version of the app, and any "nice to haves" that I had time for. The "wants" can be added to a later version.
